# Bulk search similar documents algorithm

## Theory

How search similar documents from example:
| # | Name & Phone |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1 | _Mark_ +380 **991234567** |
| 2 | Cris +380961665345 |
| 3 | **991234567** _Mark_ |

Record 1 and Record 2 is equals.
Let's try to write an algorithm that will show that these two records are the same.

## Algorithm

### Normalize text
### Convert string to vector
### Calculate two vectors distance
### Clustering
